Welcome! This is my first post on this tech blog, built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Who am I

I am Christian and I am an Italian software engineer.

## Why a tech blog?

Writing is one of the best ways to consolidate what we learn. This blog will be my space to:

- Document solutions to technical problems
- Share tutorial and guides
- Keep track on the project I'm working on

## Why in English?

I could have done this website in Italian and it would be way easier for me to do it, but I want to get better at writing technical stuff in English, so that's why I decided to go with it.

## How is this website build?

This website is built with **Jekyll**, a static websites generator written in Ruby. Here is an example on how to configure it:

```yaml
# _config.yml
title: Tech Blog
theme: minima
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
```

And this is an example of Python code:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Primi 10 numeri di Fibonacci
for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```

An example of JavaScript:

```javascript
const fetchData = async (url) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Errore:', error);
  }
};
```

## Next steps

In the next posts I will explore several topics about software development. Stay tuned!
